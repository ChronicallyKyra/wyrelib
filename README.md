Library for sending data digitally between VRChat avatars

## Howsies?
Uses contacts to send and receive data that can be serialized on either end.  

>This could theoretically be used to establish both p2p connections between avis or broadcast data to any listening avis in range.


## Timeline
Still a heavy work in progress--more of an idea/proof of concept than a product or useable piece of software at this point.

Intending on turning this into a fully implemented lib/protocol that anyone can use to communicate in a standardized way. Whether that's writing an OSC app to have private chats, a bot to broadcast instance information, or whatever you can think up.
